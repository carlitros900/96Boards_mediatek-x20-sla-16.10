# Define project-specific compilation options here.
#
# Compilation options include following variables:
# * CFLAGS   : C compiler options
# * LDFLAGS  : linker options
# * INCLUDES : C header files
# * C_FILES  : C source codes
#
# Operate those variables in Makefile way. Mostly you would add something new.
# For example, to add the header foo/foo.h and foo/foo.c:
#   $(INCLUDES) += foo/foo.h
#   $(C_FILES)  += foo/foo.c
#
# If you want to customize configuration option, use ProjectConfig.mk instead.
