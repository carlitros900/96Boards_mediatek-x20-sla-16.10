# Define project-specific configuration options here.
#
# A configuration option is defined in the simple format:
#   <KEY> = <VALUE>
# where spaces around the = character is optional.
#
# You can define the same configuration options appeared in platform.mk with
# different values. The options defined here take higher precedence.
#
# **** DO NOT **** define anything other than configuration options here.
# If you need to customize project-specific source files, compiler flags
# or required libraries, add them to CompilerOption.mk.
